Bugfixes
========

* Frontend:
  - Fix CVE-2022-22577: There is a possible XSS vulnerability in Rails / Action Pack. CSP headers
    were only sent along with responses that Rails considered as "HTML" responses. This left API
    requests without CSP headers, which could possibly expose users to XSS attacks.
  - Fix CVE-2022-27777: There is a possible XSS vulnerability in Action View tag helpers. Passing
    untrusted input as hash keys can lead to a possible XSS vulnerability.
